    "text": "I consider myself a calm and passionate person, with a touch of creativity and a deep love for sports and nature. My interests include running and hiking, as well as programming and learning languages. I’m fluent in English, Spanish is my native tongue, and I’m currently perfecting my Italian (along with mastering authentic Italian cooking). Next on my list is German. I enjoy discovering new things and am always striving to improve.\nI studied Renewable Energy Engineering driven by my passion for technology, curiosity, and concern for the environment. As an engineer, I aim to contribute my part to the energy transition and help build a more sustainable future.\nFrom August 2023 to January 2024, I participated in an international exchange in Denmark, where I took courses in Business Administration and Corporate Strategy. That experience not only gave me valuable management and strategy knowledge but also taught me new ways to connect and adapt to an environment very different from Mexico. Working in multidisciplinary, multicultural teams and forming lasting friendships enriched my personal and professional perspective.\nMy love for data analysis began in university, during courses on wind energy, solar power, and bioclimatic design, where I worked with time-series data to make project decisions. When I discovered Python, it became my go-to tool for this field. Since then, I’ve built on that foundation with certifications and personal projects (many of which I pursued simply for fun) while also contributing to academic initiatives. I look forward to using my data analysis skills and continuing to learn and grow every day."

    "text": "I’m a renewable energy engineer passionate about turning data into clear, actionable insights. With hands-on experience in ETL flow development and a strong background in quality management and continuous improvement, I focus on optimizing processes and ensuring data integrity every step of the way. I consider myself a Python enthusiast and use it to analyze data and build interactive platforms that make decision-making easier and knowledge more accessible.\nWhat truly drives me is the transformative power of data analytics, it’s so much more than managing numbers or large volumes of information. To me, its real strength lies in turning raw data into valuable information and telling clear, accessible stories from it. When data is communicated well, it becomes knowledge, a powerful connector that brings people together, unites diverse perspectives, and helps create meaningful collaboration.\nIn today’s complex world, where data is abundant, data analytics creates bridges across disciplines, communities, and cultures, helping us better understand our environment, anticipate challenges, and build solutions collectively. That’s why I see data analytics as a catalyst for social change, empowering people through shared knowledge to transform realities."
