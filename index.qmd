I’m a renewable energy engineer who’s passionate about turning data into clear, actionable insights. With hands-on experience in ETL flow development and a strong background in quality management and continuous improvement, I focus on optimizing processes and ensuring data integrity every step of the way.

I enjoy working with tools like Python, SQL, and Power BI to analyze data and build interactive platforms that make decision-making easier and knowledge more accessible. Detail-oriented and analytical, I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute innovative solutions and help create a positive, efficient workplace.

In short, I’m all about combining technical expertise with a practical mindset to support smart decisions and smooth workflows.
